This software package was developed for research purposes related to the following publication:

Zhu, X., He, J., Verscharen, D., Duan, D., & Bale, S. D. (2020). "Wave composition, propagation, and polarization of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence within 0.3 au as observed by Parker Solar Probe." The Astrophysical Journal Letters, 901(1), L3.

In this paper, we conducted a mode composition diagnosis (Glassmeier et al. 1995) and directly obtained the fractional contributions of the six magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave modes at different heliocentric distances and periods.

We welcome you to use this software package, and if you find it beneficial for your research, we kindly request that you cite the aforementioned reference in your work.

Thank you for your interest and use of this package.
